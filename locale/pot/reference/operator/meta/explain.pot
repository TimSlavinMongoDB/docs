msgid "The :operator:`$explain` operator provides information on the query plan. It returns a document that describes the process and indexes used to return the query.

msgid ":operator:`$explain` runs the actual query to determine the result. Although there are some differences between running the query with :operator:`$explain` and running without, generally, the performance will be similar between the two. So, if the query is slow, the :operator:`$explain` operation is also slow."

msgid "Additionally, the :operator:`$explain` operation reevaluates a set of candidate query plans, which may cause the :operator:`$explain` operation to perform differently than a normal query. As a result, these operations generally provide an accurate account of *how* MongoDB would perform the query, but do not reflect the length of these queries."

In normal operations the query optimizer caches winning query plans and uses them for similar related queries in the future.
