msgid "Use the :query:`$where` operator to pass either a string containing a JavaScript expression or a full JavaScript function to the query system. The :query:`$where` provides greater flexibility, but requires that the database processes the JavaScript expression or function for *each* document in the collection. Reference the document in the JavaScript expression or function using either ``this`` or ``obj`` ."
