msgid "Starting in version 2.0, MongoDB supports chained replication. A chained replication occurs when a :term:`secondary` member replicates from another secondary member instead of from the :term:`primary`. This might be the case, for example, if a secondary selects its replication target based on ping time and if the closest member is another secondary."
