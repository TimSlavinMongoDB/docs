msgid "If the :data:`~local.system.replset.settings.chainingAllowed` setting allows secondary members to sync from other secondaries, MongoDB by default prefers non-hidden members over hidden members when selecting a sync target. MongoDB will only choose hidden members as a last resort. If you want a secondary to sync from a hidden member, use the :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` database command to override the default sync target. See the documentation for :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` before using the command."
