msgid "The first operation uses :method:`rs.conf()` to set the local variable ``cfg`` to the contents of the current replica set configuration, which is a :term:`document`. The next three operations change the :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value in the ``cfg`` document for the first three members configured in the :data:`members <local.system.replset.members>` array. The final operation calls :method:`rs.reconfig()` with the argument of ``cfg`` to initialize the new configuration."
