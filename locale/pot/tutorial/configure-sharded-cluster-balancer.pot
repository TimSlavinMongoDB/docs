msgid "The balancer is a process that runs on *one* of the :program:`mongos` instances in a cluster and ensures that :term:`chunks <chunk>` are evenly distributed throughout a sharded cluster. In most deployments, the default balancer configuration is sufficient for normal operation. However, administrators might need to modify balancer behavior depending on application or operational requirements. If you encounter a situation where you need to modify the behavior of the balancer, use the procedures described in this document."
