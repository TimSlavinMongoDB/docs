msgid "The `default distribution of MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_ does **not** contain support for SSL. To use SSL you can either compile MongoDB with SSL support or use |ent-build|. See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information about SSL and MongoDB."

msgid "The MongoDB server supports listening for both SSL encrypted and unencrypted connections on the same TCP port. This allows upgrades of MongoDB clusters to use SSL encrypted connections. To upgrade from a MongoDB cluster using no SSL encryption to one using *only* SSL encryption, use the following rolling upgrade process:"
