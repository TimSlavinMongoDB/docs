msgid "By default, MongoDB will automatically close a cursor when the client has exhausted all results in the cursor. However, for :doc:`capped collections </core/capped-collections>` you may use a *Tailable Cursor* that remains open after the client exhausts the results in the initial cursor. Tailable cursors are conceptually equivalent to the ``tail`` Unix command with the ``-f`` option (i.e. with \"follow\" mode.) After clients insert new additional documents into a capped collection, the tailable cursor will continue to retrieve documents."
