msgid "A :term:`replica set` member becomes \"stale\" when its replication process falls so far behind that the :term:`primary` overwrites oplog entries the member has not yet replicated. The member cannot catch up and becomes \"stale.\" When this occurs, you must completely resynchronize the member by removing its data and performing an :ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>`."

When syncing a member, choose a time when the system has the bandwidth to move a large amount of data. Schedule the synchronization during a time of low usage or during a maintenance window."
