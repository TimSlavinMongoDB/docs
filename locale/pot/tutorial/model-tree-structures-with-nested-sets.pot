msgid "Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections <collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions that affect how you model data can affect application performance and database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-models` for a full high level overview of data modeling in MongoDB."

msgid "The *Nested Sets* pattern identifies each node in the tree as stops in a round-trip traversal of the tree. The application visits each node in the tree twice; first during the initial trip, and second during the return trip. The *Nested Sets* pattern stores each tree node in a document; in addition to the tree node, document stores the id of node's parent, the node's initial stop in the ``left`` field, and its return stop in the ``right`` field."
