When you restore a single shard, keep in mind that the :term:`balancer` process might have moved :term:`chunks <chunk>` to or from this shard since the last backup. If that's the case, you must manually move those chunks, as described in this procedure."

You do not need to delete these documents from the shard because the chunks are automatically filtered out from queries by :program:`mongos`.
