msgid "This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all components of a sharded cluster. This procedure uses :program:`mongodump` to create dumps of the :program:`mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses file system snapshots to capture the backup data, and may be more efficient in some situations if your system configuration allows file system backups. See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-filesystem-snapshots`."

If you need an exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all application writes before taking the filesystem snapshots; otherwise the snapshot will only approximate a moment of time."
