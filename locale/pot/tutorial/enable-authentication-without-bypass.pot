msgid "Enabling authentication on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the instance by requiring that users identify themselves when connecting. In this procedure, you will create the instance's first user, which must be a user administrator and then enable authentication. Then, you can authenticate as the user administrator to create additional users and grant additional access to the instance."

You can use the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` to gain access to a system with no users and authentication enabled. See :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` for the description of that procedure."
