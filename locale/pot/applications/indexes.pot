msgid "The best indexes for your application must take a number of factors into account, including the kinds of queries you expect, the ratio of reads to writes, and the amount of free memory on your system."

# 5cd95566f1f9460793609cdd895e48ae
msgid "When developing your indexing strategy you should have a deep understanding of your application's queries. Before you build indexes, map out the types of queries you will run so that you can build indexes that reference those fields. Indexes come with a performance cost, but are more than worth the cost for frequent queries on large data set. Consider the relative frequency of each query in the application and whether the query justifies an index."

msgid "The best overall strategy for designing indexes is to profile a variety of index configurations with data sets similar to the ones you'll be running in production to see which configurations perform best.Inspect the current indexes created for your collections to ensure they are supporting your current and planned queries. If an index is no longer used, drop the index."
