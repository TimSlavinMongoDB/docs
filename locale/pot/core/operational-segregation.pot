msgid "This capability provides \"data center awareness,\" which allows applications to target MongoDB deployments with consideration of the physical location of the :program:`mongod` instances. MongoDB supports segmentation of operations across different dimensions, which may include multiple data centers and geographical regions in multi-data center deployments, racks, networks, or power circuits in single data center deployments."
