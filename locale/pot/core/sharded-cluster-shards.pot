msgid "MongoDB shards data on a *per collection* basis. You *must* access all data in a sharded cluster via the :program:`mongos` instances. If you connect directly to a shard, you will see only its fraction of the cluster's data. There is no particular order to the data set on a specific shard. MongoDB does not guarantee that any two contiguous chunks will reside on a single shard."
