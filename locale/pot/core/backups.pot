msgid "Backups are an important part of any operational disaster recovery plan. A good backup plan must be able to capture data in a consistent and usable state, and operators must be able to automate both the backup and the recovery operations. Also test all components of the backup system to ensure that you can recover backed up data as needed. If you cannot effectively restore your database from the backup, then your backups are useless."
