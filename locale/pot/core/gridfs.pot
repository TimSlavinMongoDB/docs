msgid "Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, [#chunk-disambiguation]_ and stores each of those chunks as a separate document. By default GridFS limits chunk size to 256k. GridFS uses two collections to store files. One collection stores the file chunks, and the other stores file metadata."

msgid "When you query a GridFS store for a file, the driver or client will reassemble the chunks as needed. You can perform range queries on files stored through GridFS.  You also can access information from arbitrary sections of files, which allows you to \"skip\" into the middle of a video or audio file."
