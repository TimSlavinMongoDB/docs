msgid "When running with journaling, MongoDB stores and applies :doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>` in memory and in the journal before the changes are in the data files. This document discusses the implementation and mechanics of Journaling in MongoDB systems, see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-journaling` for information on configuring, tuning and managing journaling."

msgid "With journaling enabled, MongoDB creates a journal directory within the directory defined by :setting:`dbpath`, which is :file:`/data/db` by default. The journal directory holds journal files, which contain write-ahead redo logs. The directory also holds a last-sequence-number file. A clean shutdown removes all the files in the journal directory."

# 711f6497c9444df5990e7b22ab7bf678
msgid "Journal files are append-only files and have file names prefixed with ``j._``. When a journal file holds 1 gigabyte of data, MongoDB creates a new journal file. Once MongoDB applies all the write operations in the journal files, it deletes these files. Unless you write *many* bytes of data per-second, the journal directory should contain only two or three journal files."

msgid "MongoDB may preallocate journal files if the :program:`mongod` process determines that it is more efficient to preallocate journal files than create new journal files as needed. The amount of time required to pre-allocate lag might last several minutes, during which you will not be able to connect to the database. This is a one-time preallocation and does not occur with future invocations."

# 7e68ba4b4ced412bbf912af0d52f927e
msgid "The ``shared view`` stores modified data for upload to the MongoDB data files. The ``shared view`` is the only view with direct access to the MongoDB data files. When running with journaling, :program:`mongod` asks the operating system to map your existing on-disk data files to the ``shared view`` memory view. The operating system maps the files but does not load them. MongoDB later loads data files to ``shared view`` as needed."

#: ../source/core/journaling.txt:82
# 50a40edfc82f466b93d13f9b24ad1ab4
msgid "The journal is an on-disk view that stores new write operations after MongoDB applies the operation to the ``private cache`` but before applying them to the data files. The journal provides durability. If the :program:`mongod` instance were to crash without having applied the writes to the data files, the journal could replay the writes to the ``shared view`` for eventual upload to the data files."

The journal stores the operations on disk to ensure durability. MongoDB adds the operations as entries on the journal's forward pointer.
