msgid "MongoDB Enterprise includes an auditing capability for :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. The auditing facility allows administrators and users to track system activity for deployments with multiple users and applications. The audit can write the log to the console, the :term:`syslog`, a JSON file, or a BSON file."

By default, the audit facility logs all these :doc:`operations </reference/audit-operations>`; however, you may restrict the events captured using an :option:`filter <mongod --auditFilter>` configuration option to limit the logged events. The filter uses :ref:`query condition expression <query-selectors>` to limit the :ref:`operations <audit-operations>` logged."
