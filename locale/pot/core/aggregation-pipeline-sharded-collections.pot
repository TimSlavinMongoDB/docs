msgid "When operating on a sharded collection, the aggregation pipeline is split into two parts. First, the aggregation pipeline pushes all of the operators up to the first :pipeline:`$group` or :pipeline:`$sort` operation to each shard [#match-sharding]_. Then, a second pipeline runs on the :program:`mongos`. This pipeline consists of the first :pipeline:`$group` or :pipeline:`$sort` and any remaining pipeline operators, and runs on the results received from the shards."

msgid "The :pipeline:`$group` operator brings in any \"sub-totals\" from the shards and combines them: in some cases these may be structures. For example, the :group:`$avg` expression maintains a total and count for each shard; :program:`mongos` combines these values and then divides."

msgid "If an early :pipeline:`$match` can exclude shards through the use of the shard key in the predicate, then these operators are only pushed to the relevant shards."

msgid "Some :dbcommand:`aggregation pipeline <aggregate>` operations will cause :program:`mongos` instances to require more CPU resources than in previous versions. This modified performance profile may dictate alternate architectural decisions if you use the :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` extensively in a sharded environment."
