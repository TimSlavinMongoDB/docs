For basic authentication, MongoDB stores the user credentials in the ``admin`` database's :data:`system.users <admin.system.users>` collection."

msgid "You can authenticate as only one user for a given database. If you authenticate to a database as one user and later authenticate on the same database as a different user, the second authentication invalidates the first. You can, however, log into a *different* database as a different user and not invalidate your authentication on other databases, though this is not a recommended approach."
