msgid "TTL indexes are special indexes that MongoDB can use to automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time. This is ideal for some types of information like machine generated event data, logs, and session information that only need to persist in a database for a limited amount of time."

msgid "The TTL index does not guarantee that expired data will be deleted immediately. There may be a delay between the time a document expires and the time that MongoDB removes the document from the database."
