Query MongoDB for Data
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Queries are requests sent from a client a MongoDB instance that return
data. In response to a query MongoDB in the form of a :term:`cursor`
which is an interable object that yields documents.

All queries in MongoDB have the scope of a collection
:term:`collection`, and consist of 0 or more query conditions, which
limit the result set to documents that match the query
conditions. Consider the following diagram of the query process:

.. include:: /images/crud-query-stages.rst

The :method:`~db.collection.find()` method is the primary way that
clients issue queries.

Considerations
--------------

Since the ``_id`` values are generated, when querying, your values
for the ``_id`` field will differ from those displayed on this page.

Prerequisite
------------

The examples in this section query the ``orders`` collection in the
``test`` database.

Additional Information
----------------------

See the :manual:`Cursor methods </reference/method/js-cursor>` that
allow you to modify a cursor to limit the size of the result set or to
return sorted results. Also consider the reference on the
:manual:`Query and Projection Operators </reference/operator/query>`
that MongoDB provides.
