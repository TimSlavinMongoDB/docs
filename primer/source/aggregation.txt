Concepts
--------

The primary tool for data aggregation is the :manual:`aggregation
pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`, which is a stage-based method
for describing a sequence of data processing steps. The aggregation
process begins with all of the documents in a :term:`collection`, and
then passes these documents through a sequence of steps.

The aggregation pipeline supports a set of :ref:`pipeline stage operators
<aggregation-expression-operators>` which each describe a data
processing step. For example, the :pipeline:`$match` performs a basic
query, like the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method and passes only
documents that match a query expression to the next stage of the
pipeline. Similarly, you can use the :pipeline:`$project` to discard
specific fields from a document or add computed values to the
documents as they pass through a stage.

Consider the following diagram of a pipeline:
