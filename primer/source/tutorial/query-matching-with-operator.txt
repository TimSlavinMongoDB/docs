---------

MongoDB provides various operators to specify query conditions, such as
:method:`comparison operators </reference/operators/query-comparison>`.

Although there are some exceptions, query conditions with operators
generally have the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { <field>: { <operator>: <operand> } }
