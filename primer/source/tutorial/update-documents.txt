Update Existing Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

By default, the :method:`db.collection.update()` method updates a
single matching document, even if you specify an update condition that
matches multiple documents in the collection.

An update operation has three components:

1. an *update condition*, which is a query that selects documents
   eligible for update.

2. an *update document* that defines the modification.

2. an *options* specification that changes the behavior of the update
   operation.

To specify an update condition, use the same structure and
:manual:`query operators </reference/operator/query>` as for query
conditions. See :doc:`/query` for an introduction to query conditions.

Operation
---------

To change a field value, MongoDB provides :method:`update operators
</reference/operator/update>`, such as :update:`$set` to replace a
value and :update:`$inc` to increment existing numeric value.

Although the following procedures modify existing field values, some
update operators, such as :update:`$set`, :update:`$inc`, and
:update:`$mul`, will create the field if the field does not exist.
Refer to individual :method:`update operator
</reference/operator/update>` documentation to determine the behavior
when the field does not exist.

You cannot update the ``_id`` field.
