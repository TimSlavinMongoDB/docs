================================
Limit Fields in Result Documents
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Background
----------

A projection document, or *projection*, controls which fields to return
in the matching documents,

In a projection document, or *projection*, specify the field or fields
to return by including the field in the projection with the value
``1``. You can also use a projection document to suppress field or
fields by including the field in the projection with the value ``0``.

A projection document *cannot* contain both suppression and inclusion
specifications with the exception of the ``_id`` field. You can
suppress the ``_id`` field in a projection document that otherwise
specifies inclusion of fields. By default, the ``_id`` field *always
returns* unless explicitly specified in the projection document to
suppress.

Operation
---------

Pass the projection document to the :method:`db.collection.find()`
method as the *second* parameter.
