==================================
Upsert: Insert or Update Documents
==================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

By default, if the update condition matches no document, then the
update operation does not modify any document. In cases where you want
to insert a document if no matching document is found, you can specify
an ``upsert`` option to the :method:`~db.collection.update()` method.

The ``upsert`` option specifies that if the method finds matching
documents, update accordingly. *However*, if the method does not find
any matching documents, the update method adds the document to the
collection.

For brevity, in the following procedure, an ``update`` operation with
the ``upsert`` option is sometimes referred to as an ``upsert``, and
the document added through such operation is known as the ``upserted``
document.
