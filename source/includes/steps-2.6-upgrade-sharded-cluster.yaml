  Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
  sharded cluster, as described in

pre: |
  Start a single 2.6 :program:`mongos` instance with
  :setting:`configdb` pointing to the sharded cluster's :ref:`config
  servers <sharding-config-server>` and with the :option:`--upgrade
  <mongos --upgrade>` option.  The upgrade process happens before the
  instance becomes a daemon (i.e. before
  :option:`--fork <mongos --fork>`.)

  If you need to avoid reconfiguring a production :program:`mongos`
  instance, you can upgrade an existing :program:`mongos` instance to
  2.6 or start a new `mongos` instance that can reach all config
  servers.
action:
  pre: |
    Start :program:`mongos` instance:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongos --configdb <config servers> --upgrade
  post: |
    Invoking :program:`mongos` without the :option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>`
    option will fail to start until the 2.6 upgrade process is complete.
post: |
  The upgrade will prevent any chunk moves or splits from occurring
  during the upgrade process. If the data files have many sharded
  collections or if failed processes hold stale locks,
  acquiring the locks for all collections can take
  seconds or minutes. Watch the log for progress updates.

  text: Ensure ``mongos --upgrade`` completes.
  character: "'"
stepnum: 3
ref: ensure-mongos-upgrade-complete
content: |
  When the :program:`mongos` instance starts successfully, the upgrade
  of the :program:`mongos` instance is complete. If :program:`mongos`
  fails to start, check the log for more information.

  If the :program:`mongos` instance terminates or loses its connection to the
  config servers during the upgrade, you may always safely retry the
  upgrade.

  Upgrade and restart other :program:`mongos` instances in the
  sharded cluster, *without* the :option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>`
  option. See :ref:`2.6-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade` for more information.
