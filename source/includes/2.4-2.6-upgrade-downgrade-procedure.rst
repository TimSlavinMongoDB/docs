.. Substitute with either Upgrade or Downgrade

|action| Procedures
-------------------

Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.6, you **cannot** downgrade to **any** version
earlier than MongoDB 2.4. If you have ``text`` indexes, you can only
downgrade to MongoDB 2.4.10 or later.

Basic |action|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Except** as described on this page, moving
between 2.4 and 2.6 is a drop-in replacement:

- stop the existing :program:`mongod`, using the :option:`--shutdown
  <mongod --shutdown>` option as follows:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data --shutdown

  Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB :setting:`dbpath`.

- start the new :program:`mongod` instances with the same
  :setting:`dbpath` setting, for example:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data

  Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB :setting:`dbpath`.
