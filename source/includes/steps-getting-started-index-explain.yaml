   The ``cursor`` value of ``"BasicCursor"`` indicates that to fulfill
   the query, the server had to perform a :term:`collection scan`.

   The ``n`` value indicates the number of matching documents.

   The ``nscannedObjects`` indicate the number of objects read from the
   ``cursor``, which in this case indicates the number of documents
   read from the collection since MongoDB performed a collection scan.

   The ``nscanned`` indicates the number of documents scanned from the
   collection.

   In this example, the query plan indicates that ``15`` documents were
   read to return ``4`` matching documents.

   For more information on the fields in the returned document, see the
   :ref:`Explain Output Reference <explain-output>`.

   The ``cursor`` value of ``"BtreeCursor items.sku_1_status_1"``
   indicates that to fulfill the query, the server used an index,
   specifically an index named ``items.sku_1_status_1``.

   The ``n`` value indicates the number of matching documents.

   The ``nscannedObjects`` indicate the number of objects read from the
   ``cursor``, which in this case indicates the number of index entries
   read.

   The ``nscanned`` indicates the number of documents scanned from the
   collection.

   In this example, the query plan indicates that the server read ``4``
   index entries and the associated ``4`` documents from the collection
   to return ``4`` matching documents. With the index, the server needs
   to scan fewer documents to fulfill the query.
