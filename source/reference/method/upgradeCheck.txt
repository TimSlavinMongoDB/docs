.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: upgradeCheck(<document>)

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   Performs a preliminary check for upgrade preparedness to 2.6. The
   helper, available in the 2.6 :program:`mongo` shell, can run
   connected to either a 2.4 or a 2.6 server.

   The method checks for:

   - documents with index keys :ref:`longer than the index key limit
     <2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility>`,

   - documents with :limit:`illegal field names
     <Restrictions on Field Names>`,

   - collections without an ``_id`` index, and

   - indexes with invalid specifications, such as an index key with an
     empty or illegal field name.

   The method can accept a document parameter which determine the scope
   of the check:

   .. include:: /reference/method/upgradeCheck-param.rst

Behavior
--------

The optional scope document has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      db: <string>,
      collection: <string>
   }

Specify just the ``db`` field to perform the upgrade check on the
collections in the specified database.

Specify the ``db`` field and the ``collection`` field to perform the
upgrade check on the specified collection in the specified database. If
you specify the ``collection`` field only, the method perform the
upgrade check on the specified collection in the current database.

Additional 2.6 changes that affect compatibility with older versions
require manual checks and intervention. See
:doc:`/release-notes/2.6-compatibility` for details.
