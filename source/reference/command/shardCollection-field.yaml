  The index specification document
  to use as the shard key. The index must exist prior to the
  :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command, unless the collection is empty.
  If the collection is empty, in which case MongoDB creates the index
  prior to sharding the collection. New in version 2.4: The key may be
  in the form ``{ field : "hashed" }``, which will use the specified
  field as a hashed shard key.

  When ``true``, the ``unique`` option ensures that the underlying index

  Specifies the number of chunks to create
  initially when sharding an *empty* collection with a :ref:`hashed
  shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>`. MongoDB will then create and
  balance chunks across the cluster. The ``numInitialChunks`` must be
  less than ``8192`` per shard. If the collection is not empty,
  ``numInitialChunks`` has no effect.
