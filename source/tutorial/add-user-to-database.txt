========================
Add a User to a Database
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 2.5.3

Overview
--------

To ensure a system of :term:`least privilege`, MongoDB users should
have only the minimal set of privileges required. Furthermore each
application and administrator should have a distinct user in the
system to facilitate access revocation and ongoing user maintenance.

To create a, you must create the user's credentials and assign that
user :ref:`roles <roles>`. Credentials verify the user's identity to a
database, and roles determine the user's access to database resources
and operations.

For an overview of credentials and roles in MongoDB see
:doc:`/core/access-control`.

Considerations
--------------

When adding a user to multiple databases, use unique username-and-password
combinations for each database. If a user has the same password for multiple
databases, the password hash is the same and presents a security issue,
as described in :ref:`password-hashing-security`.

For users that authenticate using external mechanisms, [#external-auth-mechanisms]
you do not need to provide credentials when creating users.

For all users, select the roles that have the exact required :ref:`privileges
<privileges>`. If the correct roles do not exist, :doc:`create roles
</tutorial/define-roles>`.

You can create a user without assigning roles, choosing instead to assign the
roles later. To do so, create the user with an empty
:data:`~admin.system.users.roles` array.

.. [#external-auth-mechanisms] :doc:`Kerberos
   </tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication>`,
   :doc:`LDAP </tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication>`, and
   x.509 certificates provide external authentication mechanisms.

Prerequisites
-------------

To create a user on a system that uses :ref:`authentication <authentication>`,
you must authenticate as a user administrator. If you have not yet created a
user administrator, do so as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/add-user-administrator`.

.. include:: /includes/access-create-user.rst

The :authrole:`userAdmin` and :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` roles both
provide those actions.
