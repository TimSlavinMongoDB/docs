Install MongoDB on Debian
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial outlines the steps to install :term:`MongoDB` on Debian
systems. The tutorial uses ``.deb`` packages to install. While some
Debian distributions include their own MongoDB packages, the official
MongoDB packages are generally more up to date.

.. note::

   This tutorial applies to both Debian systems and versions of Ubuntu
   Linux prior to 9.10 "Karmic" which do not use Upstart. Other Ubuntu
   users will want to follow the :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu`
   tutorial.

Package Options
---------------

The downloads repository provides the ``mongodb-10gen`` package,
which contains the latest **stable** release. Additionally you can
:ref:`install previous releases <install-debian-version-pinning>` of MongoDB.

You cannot install this package concurrently with the ``mongodb``,
``mongodb-server``, or ``mongodb-clients`` packages that
your release of Debian may include.

Install MongoDB
---------------

Configure Package Management System (APT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Debian package management tools (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``) ensure
package consistency and authenticity by requiring that distributors
sign packages with GPG keys.

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command to install the latest stable version of
MongoDB:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get install mongodb-10gen

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB!

.. _install-debian-version-pinning:

Manage Installed Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``mongodb-10gen`` package to install previous versions
of MongoDB. To install a specific release, append the version number
to the package name, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get install mongodb-10gen=2.2.3

This will install the ``2.2.3`` release of MongoDB. You can specify
any available version of MongoDB; however ``apt-get`` **will** upgrade
the ``mongodb-10gen`` package when a newer version becomes available. Use
the following *pinning* procedure to prevent unintended upgrades.

To pin a package, issue the following command at the system prompt to
*pin* the version of MongoDB at the currently installed version:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo "mongodb-10gen hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
