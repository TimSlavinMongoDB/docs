===========================
Configure MongoDB with FIPS
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.6

Overview
--------

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government
computer security standard used to certify software modules and libraries
that encrypt and decrypt data securely. You can configure MongoDB to run
with a FIPS 140-2 certified library for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to run by
default or as needed from the command line.

Prerequisites
-------------

Only the `MongoDB Enterprise`_ version supports FIPS mode.

Your system must have an OpenSSL library configured with the FIPS 140-2
module before you can run your :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` in
FIPS mode.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x (RHEL 6.x) or its derivatives such as
CentOS 6.x, the OpenSSL toolkit must be at least
``openssl-1.0.1e-16.el6_5`` to use FIPS mode. To upgrade the toolkit
for these platforms, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum update openssl

Linux periodically executes a process to `prelink` dynamic libraries with
pre-assigned addresses. This process modifies the OpenSSL libraries,
specifically ``libcrypto``. The OpenSSL FIPS mode will subsequently fail
the signature check performed upon startup to ensure ``libcrypto`` has not
been modified since compilation.

To configure the Linux prelink process to not prelink ``libcrypto``:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo bash -c "echo '-b /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.*' >>/etc/prelink.conf.d/openssl-prelink.conf"

Configuring MongoDB to use SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for details about configuring OpenSSL.

Run ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` instance in FIPS mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform these steps after you :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
