======================
Upgrade MongoDB to 2.6
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. TODO remove below *test only* blurb when update to 2.6

MongoDB 2.6 is currently in development. While 2.6-release-candidates
are currently available, these versions of MongoDB are for **testing
only and not for production use**.

In the general case, the upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6 is a
binary-compatible "drop-in" upgrade: shut down the :program:`mongod`
instances and replace them with :program:`mongod` instances running
2.6. **However**, before you attempt any upgrade, familiarize yourself
with the content of this document, particularly the
:ref:`2.6-upgrade-considerations`, the procedure for :ref:`upgrading
sharded clusters <2.6-upgrade-cluster>`, and the considerations for
:ref:`reverting to 2.4 after running 2.6
<2.6-downgrade-considerations>`.

.. _2.6-upgrade-considerations:

Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists
--------------------------------------

When upgrading, consider the following:

Upgrade Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 2.6, you must be running
2.4. If you're running a version of MongoDB before 2.4, you *must*
upgrade to 2.4 before upgrading to 2.6. See
:doc:`/release-notes/2.4-upgrade` for the procedure to upgrade from
2.2 to 2.4.

If you use MMS Backup, ensure that you're running *at least* version
``v20131216.1`` of the Backup agent before upgrading.

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before beginning the upgrade procedure, connect a 2.6 :program:`mongo` shell
to your MongoDB 2.4
:program:`mongos` or :program:`mongod`
and run the :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDbs()` to check your data set
for compatibility. This is a preliminary automated check. Asses and
resolve all issues identified by :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDbs()`.

Some changes in MongoDB 2.6 require manual checks and
intervention. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-compatibility` for an
explanation of these changes. Resolve all incompatibilities in your
deployment before continuing.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.6 includes significant changes to the authorization model,
which requires changes to the way that MongoDB stores users'
credentials. As a result, in addition to upgrading MongoDB processes,
if your deployment uses authentication and authorization, after
upgrading all MongoDB process to 2.6 you must also upgrade the
authorization model.

Before beginning the upgrade process for a deployment that uses
authentication and authorization:

- Ensure that at least one user exists in the ``admin`` database.

- Upgrade all drivers (i.e. client libraries) **before**
  :program:`mongod` instances.

- You must fully complete the upgrade procedure for *all* MongoDB
  processes before upgrading the authorization model.

See :ref:`2.6-upgrade-authorization-model` for a complete discussion
of the upgrade procedure for the authorization model including
additional requirements and procedures.

Downgrade Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.6, you **cannot** downgrade to **any** version
earlier than MongoDB 2.4. If you have ``text`` indexes, you can only
downgrade to MongoDB 2.4.10 or later.

Upgrade MongoDB Processes
-------------------------

.. _2.6-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrade Standalone ``mongod`` Instance to MongoDB 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:program:`mongod` from version 2.4 to 2.6. To upgrade from version
2.2 to 2.6, :doc:`upgrade to version 2.4
</release-notes/2.4-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from 2.4 to 2.6.

#. Download binaries of the latest release in the 2.6 series from the
   `MongoDB Download Page`_. See :doc:`/installation` for more
   information.

#. Shut down your :program:`mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the 2.6 :program:`mongod` binary and restart :program:`mongod`.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. _2.6-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrade a Replica Set to 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a replica set from
MongoDB 2.4 to MongoDB 2.6. To upgrade from MongoDB 2.2 to 2.6,
:doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to version 2.4
</release-notes/2.4-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6.

You can upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6 using a "rolling" upgrade to
minimize downtime by upgrading the members individually while the other
members are available:

#. Upgrade the :term:`secondary` members of the set one at a time by
   shutting down the :program:`mongod` and replacing the 2.4 binary
   with the 2.6 binary. After upgrading a :program:`mongod` instance,
   wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state
   before upgrading the next instance.
   To check the member's state, issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

#. Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the the :program:`mongo` shell to
   step down the :term:`primary` and force the set to :ref:`failover
   <replica-set-failover>`. :method:`rs.stepDown()`
   expedites the failover procedure and is preferable to shutting down
   the primary directly.

#. When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped down
   and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the
   previous primary and replace the :program:`mongod` binary with the
   2.6 binary and start the new instance.

Replica set failover is not instant but will render the set
unavailable accept writes until the failover process
completes. Typically this takes 30 seconds or more: schedule the
upgrade procedure during a scheduled maintenance window.

.. _2.6-upgrade-cluster:

Upgrade a Sharded Cluster to 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only upgrade sharded clusters to 2.6 if **all** members of the
cluster are currently running instances of 2.4. The only supported
upgrade path for sharded clusters running 2.2 is via 2.4.

Prerequisites
`````````````

Upgrading a :term:`sharded cluster` from MongoDB version 2.4 to 2.6
requires that you run a 2.6 :program:`mongos` with the
:option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>` option, as described in this
procedure. The upgrade process does not require downtime.

While the upgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection meta-data. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list
  of sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on
  the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the
  cluster meta-data.

Upgrade Sharded Clusters
````````````````````````

#. Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
   sharded cluster, as described in
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

#. Start a single 2.6 :program:`mongos` instance with
   :setting:`configdb` pointing to the sharded cluster's :ref:`config
   servers <sharding-config-server>` and with the :option:`--upgrade
   <mongos --upgrade>` option.  The upgrade process happens before the
   instance becomes a daemon (i.e. before
   :option:`--fork <mongos --fork>`.)

   If you need to avoid reconfiguring a production :program:`mongos`
   instance, you can upgrade an existing :program:`mongos` instance to
   2.6 or start a new `mongos` instance that can reach all config
   servers.

   Start :program:`mongos` instance:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongos --configdb <config servers> --upgrade

   Invoking :program:`mongos` without the :option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>`
   option will fail to start until the 2.6 upgrade process is complete.

   The upgrade will prevent any chunk moves or splits from occurring
   during the upgrade process. If the data files have many sharded
   collections or if failed processes hold stale locks,
   acquiring the locks for all collections can take
   seconds or minutes. Watch the log for progress updates.

#. When the :program:`mongos` instance starts successfully, the upgrade
   of the :program:`mongos` instance is complete. If :program:`mongos`
   fails to start, check the log for more information.

   If the :program:`mongos` instance terminates or loses its connection to the
   config servers during the upgrade, you may always safely retry the
   upgrade.

#. Upgrade and restart other :program:`mongos` instances in the
   sharded cluster, *without* the :option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>`
   option. See :ref:`2.6-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade` for more information.

.. _2.6-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade:

Complete Sharded Cluster Upgrade
````````````````````````````````

After you have successfully upgraded *all* :program:`mongos` instances,
you can upgrade the other instances in your MongoDB deployment.

.. warning::

   Do not upgrade :program:`mongod` instances until after you have
   upgraded *all* :program:`mongos` instances.

While the balancer is still disabled, upgrade the components of your
sharded cluster in the following order:

- Upgrade all 3 :program:`mongod` config server instances, leaving
  the *first* system in the :option:`mongos --configdb` argument to upgrade
  *last*.

- Upgrade each shard, one at a time, upgrading the :program:`mongod`
  secondaries before running :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and
  upgrading the primary of each shard.

When this process is complete, :ref:`re-enable the
balancer <sharding-balancing-enable>`.

.. _2.6-upgrade-authorization-model:

Upgrade User Authorization Data to 2.6 Format
---------------------------------------------

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/important-upgrade-auth-model-prerequisites.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-auth-upgrade-recommendation.rst

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Recommended**

  .. include:: /includes/fact-auth-upgrade-recommendation.rst

  If you decide to upgrade the user authorization
  model immediately instead of waiting the recommended "burn in"
  period, then for sharded clusters, you must wait at least 10 seconds
  after upgrading the sharded clusters to run the authorization
  upgrade script.

- For a replica set, it is only necessary to run the upgrade process on
  the :term:`primary` as the changes will automatically replicate to
  the secondaries.

- For a sharded cluster, connect to a :program:`mongos` and run the
  upgrade procedure to upgrade the the cluster's authorization data. By
  default, the procedure will upgrade the authorization data of the
  shards as well.

  To override this behavior, run the upgrade command with the
  additional parameter ``upgradeShards: false``. If you choose to
  override, you must run the upgrade procedure on the :program:`mongos`
  first, and then run the procedure on the :term:`primary` members of
  each shard.

- For a sharded cluster, do **not** run the upgrade process directly
  against the :doc:`config servers
  </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect and authenticate to the :program:`mongod` instance for a
   single deployment or a :program:`mongos` for a sharded cluster as an
   ``admin`` database user with the role
   :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`.

#. Run the :dbcommand:`authSchemaUpgrade` command in the ``admin``
   database to update the user data:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      res = db.getSiblingDB("admin").runCommand({authSchemaUpgrade: 1 });

      print(tojson(res));

   In case of error, you may safely rerun the
   :dbcommand:`authSchemaUpgrade` command.

For a sharded cluster, the procedure will upgrade the authorization
data of the shards as well and the upgrade is complete. You can,
however, override this behavior by including ``upgradeShards: false``
in the command. If you override the behavior, after upgrading on
:program:`mongos`, you will need to connect to the primary for each
shard and repeat the upgrade process after upgrading on the
:program:`mongos`.

Result
~~~~~~

The upgrade procedure copies the version 2.4 ``admin.system.users``
collection to ``admin.system.backup_users``.

The upgrade procedure leaves the version 2.4 ``<non-admin
database>.system.users`` collection(s) intact.
